        <p class="style1">Java is one of the most popular <strong> programming languages </strong>used to create Web applications and platforms. It was designed for flexibility, allowing developers to write code that would run on any machine, regardless of architecture or platform. According to the Java home page, more than 1 billion computers and 3 billion mobile phones worldwide run Java.

    <h2> What will I get when I download Java software?</h2>
    <p id="important">The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is what you get when you download Java software. The JRE consists of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), Java platform core classes, and supporting Java platform libraries. The JRE is the runtime portion of Java software, which is all you need to run it in your Web browser.</p>

    <h2>What is Java Plug-in software?</h2>
    <p>The Java Plug-in software is a component of the <em>Java Runtime Environment (JRE).</em> The JRE allows applets written in the Java programming language to run inside various browsers. The Java Plug-in software is not a standalone program and cannot be installed separately. I have heard the terms Java Virtual Machine and JVM. Is this Java software? The Java Virtual Machine is only one aspect of Java software that is involved in web interaction. The Java Virtual Machine is built right into your Java software download, and helps run Java applications.</p>
